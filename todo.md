Things that would be nice to do:

 - An option to put yourself in a queue to reserve the server, in the case that it's locked and several people want to use it next.
 - Integrate it into Linux:
   - A warning message at user login, that lets them know if someone is already running an experiment.
   - An optional bash prompt modification that adds a little (!) or something if an experiment is running.
   - Use of `wall` or similar (maybe there's something a bit more modern) that tells everyone on the server when someone begins an experiment (though careful, this might get annoying, maybe there's a better way)
